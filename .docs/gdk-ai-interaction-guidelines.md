# Interaction Guidelines for Delphi Development

## Questioning and Clarification
- **Do not make assumptions** - Always ask questions when unclear
- **One question at a time** with numbered suggestions
- **Evaluate thoroughly** - Analyze complex tasks first, execute simple ones directly

## Code Delivery
- **Complex assignments**: No code before assignment is well understood
  - First clarification questions (number depends on complexity)
  - Then brief summary of understanding + ask for confirmation
  - Then write code
- **Simple assignments**: Deliver code directly when requested

## Context Awareness (Forms)
For complex forms with multiple tabs/panels:
- Determine which tab/panel/section is being modified
- Search and list all UI components in that specific context
- Verify component ownership via naming patterns
- When in doubt about component context: ask for clarification
- May always ask for a screenshot in unclear situations

## Communication Style
- **Brief and technical** - No fluff, but complete technical details where relevant
- **Expert-to-expert level** - No basic explanations, assume prior knowledge
- Numbered suggestions for choices/questions
